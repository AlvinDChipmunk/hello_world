I'm wanting to learn Unreal for a job opening in October.  I've been going to San Diego Comic Con for the past 23 years in a row (start year 1994) in the Alvin costume.  Got to trade lines in a scene in a movie with Mark Hamill.

Other things of significance include being involved with an indie film making group, CineMason Productions, as their lead tech and engineer.  Have repaired swords and made armor and web sites for that group.
